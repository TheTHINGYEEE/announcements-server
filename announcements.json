  "Announcements Website released!": "The 2nd version of this website is now here. This all was made by TheTHINGYEEEE, the owner of ThingySMP. When I add an announcement, it will automatically show up here at this website. No delays whatsoever. However, you need to refresh the page so that this page reloads the contents and get up to date information. That's all. Have a nice day!",
  "Website still updating": "As of now, the website is still currently being updated by TheTHINGYEEEE. He still needs to fix bugs and upgrade the desgin i guess. Just wait for it :)",
  "More web projects for ThingySMP!": "There will be a few incoming web projects for the server itself such as a list of players in-game on a website, the map of the server and much more! Stay tuned on the server!",
  "Server will not be joinable using native Domain IP": "The reason why you can't join the server using 'thingysmp.xyz' anymore is because I am gonna be turning it to a website. But you would say that why not put the website and the server together? Well, that's not entirely possible. However, you can still join the server using the IPs 'play.thingysmp.xyz' or 'mc.thingysmp.xyz'. So be reminded of that. That's all, enjoy playing!"
